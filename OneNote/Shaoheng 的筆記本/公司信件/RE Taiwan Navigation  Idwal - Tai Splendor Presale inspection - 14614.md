陳船長您好：  
   
公司計劃出售貴輪，為日後賣船計劃執行，需先進行正式驗船後將該報告提供予潛在買家查看，目前已安排第三方驗船公司Idwal Marine指派驗船師Mr Roger Reyes(如附件)，該人員預計當地時間5月24日在本卸貨港智利San Antonio港登輪檢查，敬請船長詳閱Idwal Guide to Masters and Vessel Managers 1.12(如附件)配合本次驗船事項，並將Documents Checklist (Ver 3.4)(如附件)上所需文件預先備妥。  
   
提醒船長，本出售案仍在初步階段，最終是否順利出售或仍由公司以期租方式營運與否，需待公司內部討論後才有定案。  
   
以上，謝謝船長配合辦理。  
   
敬祝 航安  
   
業務部 高偉倫 敬上

Dear Wade,  
   
Many thanks for your email and following a phone call.   
   
As discussed, we would suggest carrying out the inspection either at San Antonio or Coquimbo. Trust you have received our quotation via your account and attached it here for your reference. The service fee applies to the inspection at the unloading port or the first loading port.  
Surveyors are ready for the inspection. Awaiting the agent details and LOI.  
   
In addition to the above please note that this inspection is currently on our standard turn-around time which is five working days from inspection completion, if you require information sooner, the Fast track service suits, with this you will receive all the report, photos and vessel documents within 3 working days, we charge 899USD for this service. Please let me know if you would like to include this.  
   
I also wanted to introduce our new vessel-level ESG report to you, with ESG being of vital importance, it should also be looked at on a vessel basis, as well as the environmental factors it also covers the Social and Governance elements focusing on a specific asset level. We have recently launched the new product vessel ESG report, believe this will further increase the quality of your assets/investment. Would you like to add this valued service to the captioned survey, it will cost 1500USD for each vessel.  
   
Any queries feel free to contact me.  
   
Thank you and look forward to hearing back from you soon.  
   
Best regards,

**Subject:** Taiwan Navigation | Idwal - Presale inspection   
   
Dear Mr YOU and Mr KAO,  
   
I hope this message finds you well.   
   
I’m Johnny Shen from Idwal Marine, we are the independent 3rd party who leading the market in this industry field. I was referred to you by our mutual colleagues at Sumitomo Corp, who mentioned that you have shown interest in our pre-sale inspection services. I am writing to provide you with more information about this valuable offering that has been well-received by our clients and has become an essential service in the snp market. Our pre-sale inspection service is designed to ensure that vessels are thoroughly examined before they are put up for sale. This not only enhances transparency but also builds trust between sellers and buyers, facilitating smoother transactions.   
   
Here are some key points about our service:  
Typically, as sellers you would invite buyers to inspect the ship at their convenience which can often be a chaotic process and places crew at bad morale. However, what we propose is that we conduct the inspection on behalf of yourselves (as sellers) for your account, and then work closely with you to distribute the reports to interested buyers for 1500USD per copy. Any proceeds from the re-selling of the reports are rebated 500USD back to the sellers.   
In summary, see below some of the key benefits of this service:  
•            Enhances the number of serious buyers & potential for “clean” offers.  
•            Increases chances of a successful transaction.  
•            Creates a level playing field between multiple buyers.  
•            Permits reliance on the report data by all parties who purchase the report.  
•            Cost-effective solution which often neutralises the inspection costs.  
•            Sellers remain in full control.  
•            Reports kept confidential to serious buyers only.  
•            Helps preserve crew morale.  
•            High transaction success rate.  
   
Ultimately, this service places the control back in the hands of the seller, and offers you the opportunity to have a single, credible, independent report available for interested buyers to purchase and use in their decision making while also passing on our consent to rely upon the report for their own commercial use.   
   
Given that you have several vessels about to be put on the market, please advise the vessel name and their schedules so that I can update you on the proposal for your consideration. I believe our pre-sale inspection service could be of significant benefit to you. It would be my pleasure to discuss this further with you at your convenience. Please let me know a suitable time for you, and I will arrange the call accordingly. I look forward to speaking with you soon and potentially working together to ensure the success of your vessel sales.   
   
Thank you.  
Best regards,  
   
**Johnny Shen**
