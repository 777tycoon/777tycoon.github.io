The Maritime Safety Committee (MSC 95) (3 to 12 June 2015) agreed to revise SOLAS regulation II-1/3-8 and associated guidelines (MSC.1/Circ.1175) and to develop new guidelines for safe mooring operations for all ships in order to prevent unsafe and unhealthy work situations during mooring operations.   This work led to the adoption of amended SOLAS regulation II-1/3-8  (resolution MSC.474(102)), which entered into force on 1 January 2024, and the approval of the Revised guidance on shipboard towing and mooring equipment ([MSC.1/Circ.1175/Rev.1](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/Documents/MSC.1-Circ.1175-Rev.1.pdf)) for ships constructed on or after 1 January 2024*, as well as the following:

- new [MSC.1/Circ.1619](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/Documents/MSC.1-Circ.1619%20-.pdf) on Guidelines on the design of mooring arrangements and the selection of appropriate mooring equipment and fittings for safe mooring; and
- new [MSC.1/Circ.1620](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/Documents/MSC.1-Circ.1620%20-.pdf) on Guidelines for inspection and maintenance of mooring equipment including lines.

_*The Guidance on shipboard towing and mooring equipment (MSC.1/Circ.1175) remains in effect for ships constructed on or after 1 January 2007 but before 1 January 2024_

### Videos on safe mooring  

The below videos produced by the European Harbour Masters’ Committee, a regional committee of the International Harbour Masters’ Association, support the effort of IMO in making ship mooring operations safer for the ship and their crews, as well as shore-based mooring personnel (N.B.
