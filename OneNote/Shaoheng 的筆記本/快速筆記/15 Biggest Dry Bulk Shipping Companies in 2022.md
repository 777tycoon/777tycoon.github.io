In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest dry bulk shipping companies in 2022. For more companies, head on over to **5 Biggest Dry Bulk Shipping Companies in 2022****.**  
If there is one sector that can truly be said to form the backbone of the modern day world, it is the shipping industry. Each day countless ships traverse the oceans to supply goods from one country to another. The scope of today's shipping can be gauged from the fact that in 2020 — even as the coronavirus pandemic was in full swing — a staggering [25 million twenty feet equivalents](https://sinay.ai/en/what-are-the-major-shipping-routes/) (TEUs) of cargo shipped on the Trans-Pacific routes. The Panama Canal, which is perhaps the most important shipping point on the planet because it serves as the only link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, sees a [whopping 14,000 ships](https://www.ukpandi.com/news-and-resources/articles/2021/panama-canal-data-for-current-operations/) pass through it every year. Another important shipping point is the Suez Canal, which accounts for 12% of global trade. In fact, when the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan) Ltd. (LSE:EGMD.L)'s Ever Given blocked the canal for a mere six days in 2021, an estimated [$400 million of goods](https://theweek.com/speedreads/973967/suez-canal-blockage-reportedly-costing-400-million-hour-could-last-weeks) were delayed each hour.  
One crucial subsegment of the shipping industry is the dry bulk segment. While goods and products are transported in containers, hence the twenty feet equivalent (TEU) designation, commodities such as coal, iron, and others are transported via special ships called bulk carriers. These are also some of the most complex vessels to operate since cargo such as grain shifts position easily within the ship, which then ends up affecting the vessel's balance. Additionally, if the air within the vessel is not controlled, then cargo such as coal can catch fire as well. These vessels also form a big chunk of the global maritime shipping industry, with some estimates laying down that up to [20% of all the freight](https://www.lr.org/en/insights/articles/bulk-sector-to-benefit-from-adoption-of-new-technologies/) is carried by them.  
The growth in global computing power and the continued integration of business processes with computers is also making its mark on dry bulk shipping. For instance, [The Signal Group's](https://www.thesignalgroup.com/) Signal Ocean Platform allows dry bulk shipping companies to bring together a myriad of different data points such as port locations, tonnage and cargo lists, real time vessel locations, and costs to feed algorithms and artificial intelligence models and generate action plans. Another dry bulk technology company, [S.A. MALLIAROUDAKIS MARITIME (UK) Ltd,](http://www.smmnet.com/aboutus.html) provides a wide variety of software for dry bulk operators that allow them to determine the ship's under keel clearances, squat, dead weight tonnage (DWT) gain or loss, floating position, stability, and crew rest hours among others. These are some of the most important aspects of a dry bulk carrier since they need to be closely monitored during the loading and unloading of a vessel, which, as we mentioned above, is prone to capsizing due to the nature of its cargo.  
In terms of overall size, [Valuates Reports](https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/QYRE-Othe-4A274/dry-bulk-shipping) estimates that the industry was worth $35 billion in 2020 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% to sit at $101 billion in 2027. The research firm believes that growth in global populations and rising economic conditions alongside a growing demand for coal as a power generation source will drive the dry bulk shipping industry's growth. In terms of the commodities shipped, iron ore is the largest segment of the industry and will remain so as well, as higher industrialization drives the global steel demand.  
Some top dry bulk shipping companies on our list are Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:[SBLK](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/star%20bulk%20carriers%20corp/1386716/)), Oldendorff Carriers GmbH & Co., and Golden Ocean Group Limited (NASDAQ:[GOGL](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/golden%20ocean%20group%20ltd/1029145/)).
